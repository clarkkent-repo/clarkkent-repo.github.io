  <p>
  This machine is showing only 3 open ports and one of them allow anonymous access in which you can find a mdb file and inside it an email with password for a user to login. Than it become more hard as it's a Windows machine but the trick is proper enumeration. Then you find that Powershell is enable and Administrator credentials are locally stored with DPAPI. Multiple ways are available to connect, I tried to elustrate use of Powershell, Unicorn, Empire and Mimikatz as attacking vectors.
